        When is this called?
          This function should be either manually called by your program
          to setup this behaviour alone, or more commonly, via
          :meth:`~py_trees.behaviour.Behaviour.setup_with_descendants`
          or :meth:`~py_trees.trees.BehaviourTree.setup`, both of which
          will iterate over this behaviour, it's children (it's children's
          children ...) calling :meth:`~py_trees.behaviour.Behaviour.setup`
          on each in turn.

          If you have vital initialisation necessary to the success
          execution of your behaviour, put a guard in your
          :meth:`~py_trees.behaviour.Behaviour.initialise` method
          to protect against entry without having been setup.

        What to do here?
          Delayed one-time initialisation that would otherwise interfere
          with offline rendering of this behaviour in a tree to dot graph
          or validation of the behaviour's configuration.

          - Hardware or driver initialisation
          - Middleware initialisation (e.g. ROS pubs/subs/services)
          - A parallel checking for a valid policy configuration after
            children have been added or removed
